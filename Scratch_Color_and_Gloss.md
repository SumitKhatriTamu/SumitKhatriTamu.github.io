The effects of optical & surface properties like color and gloss (correlated to surface roughness), and the impact of lighting and viewing angles on scratch visibiliy have been studied experimentally. By ultilizing the virtual scratch visiblity analysis cycle, all these factors can be studied parameterically. Here I have presented some results of a study done on polycarbonate samples with 5 colors and 2 gloss levels supplied by SABIC Innovative Plastics. The study entails the experimental scratch characterization and virtual replication of the same; essentially creating the digital twin for surface scratch.

The primary challenge in scratch visibility studies lies in the multidisciplinary nature of surface appearance research, encompassing physical properties and psychophysics. To study scratch visibility it is essential to understand how humans perceive and interact with various surface attributes and environments. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 2006 report on visual appearance defines it as "A visual sensation through which an object is perceived to have attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, gloss, transparency, opacity, etc.". Among these attributes, color, texture, gloss, and translucency are the major optical parameters defining appearance.
