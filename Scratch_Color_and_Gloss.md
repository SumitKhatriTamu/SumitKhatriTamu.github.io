A polymer sample's overall scratch performance involves a combination of scratch deformation resistance and visibility to the human eye. The effects of surface texture, optical properties like color and gloss, and the impact of lighting and viewing angles are often limited to costly experimental observations.

Experimentally addressing scratch visibility has been effectively done through various standardized methods. One commonly used method involves an enclosed chamber (black box) with a light source having rotational freedom around a platform for the scratched sample. A top-fixed digital camera serves as the viewing device, while psychophysical tests can be concurrently conducted by trained individuals standing at a prescribed distance and observing the scratched surface at different orientations of the light source relative to the scratched sample. This setup offers comprehensive coverage of lighting orientation and viewing angles along one axis.

The primary challenge in scratch visibility studies lies in the multidisciplinary nature of surface appearance research, encompassing physical properties and psychophysics. To study scratch visibility it is essential to understand how humans perceive and interact with various surface attributes and environments. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 2006 report on visual appearance defines it as "A visual sensation through which an object is perceived to have attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, gloss, transparency, opacity, etc.". Among these attributes, color, texture, gloss, and translucency are the major optical parameters defining appearance.
