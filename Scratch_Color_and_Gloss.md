The effects of optical & surface properties like color and gloss (correlated to surface roughness), and the impact of lighting and viewing angles on scratch visibiliy have been studied experimentally. By ultilizing the virtual scratch visiblity analysis cycle, all these factors can be studied parameterically. Here I have presented some results of a study done on polycarbonate samples with 5 colors and 2 gloss levels supplied by SABIC Innovative Plastics. The study entails the experimental scratch characterization and virtual replication of the same; essentially creating the digital twin for surface scratch.

The first step to create a digital twin of the experimental scratch is capturing the exact dimensions with high fidelity. This is achieved by utilizing an confocal microscpe which provides the 3D CAD model of scratch. The next step is to replicate the optical and surface properties of the material. The surface color is anlayzed using ASTM Standard E308-22 as shown in the figrue below:

The surface roughness is different along the scratch and surrounding. Moreover, it varies along the linearly increasing load scratch path. The digital scratch is first divided in to scratch path and the surrounding area. Following, further subdivison of the scratch path to apply the varying roughness in different regions.

The experimental resutls showed that the white color improves scratch visibility resistance as the shoulder visibility gets masked by the white color. While low gloss samples perform better than the high gloss ones in all other colors due the shoulder visibility as shoulder visibility is governed by reference surface.

The virtual scrach visibility anlysis  was able to replicate the above results with good correlation as shown below.

Additionally, The visibility simulation is able to capture the effect of angle on scratch visibility. The BRDF functions used for simulation are validated for all possible orientations. This allows simulations to go beyond the single axis rotation limitation of the  experimental setup.

Dark colors (Black, Red, Green and Blue) have similar low scratch visibility performance mainly due to enhanced shoulder visibility. Low gloss samples perform better than the high gloss ones in dark colors due to the shoulder visibility. White color improves scratch visibility resistance as the shoulder visibility gets masked by the white color for both low and high gloss samples. Virtual simulation is able to showcase all the experimental findings to a satisfactory level.
The visibility simulation enables going beyond the experimental limitation of single axis of viewing angles and allows analysis in other possible scenarios.
