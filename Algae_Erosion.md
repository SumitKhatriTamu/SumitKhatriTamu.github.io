A major factor influencing failures of water-based elastomeric roof coatings is extended exposure to ponding water, biofilm development, attachment, and damage. Development of improved coatings is slow due to outdoor exposure tests that can take years. The goal of this work is to develop accelerated test methods and to understand the mechanism of biofilm-induced damage of coatings. Two model acrylic coatings on TPO substrates were exposed to lab-controlled accelerated growth of biofilm (algae) in ponding water to learn about coating damage before and after subsequent wet-dry cycles.

Three distinct damage features in sequence were observed: (1) pit formation on the coating surfaces, (2) the biofilm mud-cracking induced coating surface damage upon drying, and (3) erosion (surface cracks) of coating in the mud-cracked region over the wet-dry cycles.

Adhesion of the biofilm to the coating surface, drying of the biofilm, and thickness of the biofilm are the critical factors that govern the erosion on the coating surfaces. The effect of the wet-dry cycle time period was studied with respect to the surface erosion of the coatings. The mechanisms of biofilm-induced erosion during wet-dry cycling are postulated based on the mechanics and experimental observations. A new accelerated testing methodology for evaluating long-term roof coating performance is proposed.
