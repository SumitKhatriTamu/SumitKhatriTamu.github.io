The analysis of scratch resistance of polymeric surfaces depends on the base material's influence on deformation characteristics. This has been tackled by FEM simulations in previous research with a lot of success. But one of the most important aspects, the influence of human vision and the capacity of textures to mask scratch damage, still depends on the experimental results. To tackle this fundamental issue, we have developed a simultaneous FEM and virtual reality simulation of scratch visibility powered by physics-based 3D rendering. This study covers all aspects of scratch performance analysis from deformation characteristics to visibility. Visibility simulations provide a low-cost and efficient way to test the effectiveness of textures, patterns, and general scratches and complete the full cycle of design-development-testing and optimization virtually.
