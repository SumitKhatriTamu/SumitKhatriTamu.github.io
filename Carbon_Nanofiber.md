Our primary objective was to investigate the formation mechanisms of wavy carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and nanocoils. These structures have garnered significant interest due to their unique properties, including high surface area, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity.

The precursor material plays a pivotal role in determining the final structure of CNFs during carbonization.
The choice of precursor significantly influences the resulting morphology of CNFs.
Controlled Microbuckling Technique:
To induce wavy structures, we employed a controlled microbuckling technique.
The process involved subjecting the precursor materials to mechanical deformation before carbonization.
By precisely controlling the buckling parameters (such as strain, temperature, and time), we aimed to create periodic undulations in the resulting CNFs.

Wavy CNFs:
Our experiments successfully led to the formation of wavy CNFs.
These CNFs exhibited periodic undulations along their length.
The wavy morphology significantly increased the surface area, making them suitable for applications such as gas adsorption, catalysis, and reinforcement in composites.

Nanocoils:
In addition to wavy CNFs, we observed the formation of nanocoils.
Nanocoils are helical structures that emerged during the carbonization process.
Their unique geometry suggests potential applications in nanoelectronics, sensors, and energy storage devices.

The figure above shows the total strain energy retained in scenarios of sinusoidal and helical buckling of the contraction of a 400 nm fiber originally 6 cm in length. The mode shape with the lowest energy will be favored, this illustrates the evolution from sinusoidal to helical configuration due to the minimization of energy as the contraction goes from 10% to 60%. (All scale bars are set at 1μm).
