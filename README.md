Utilizing convolution neural networks (CNN) to identify and characterize the scratch generated on the polymeric surfaces. With the ultimate goal of combining the CNN model with FEA and virtual reality-based scratch generation and visibility analysis.

- FEA with Virtual Reality 
The analysis of scratch resistance of polymeric surfaces depends on the base material's influence on deformation characteristics. This has been tackled by FEM simulations in our lab's previous research with a lot of success. But the third and one of the most important aspects, the influence of human vision and the capacity of textures to mask scratch damage, still depend on the experimental results. 
To tackle this fundamental issue, we are currently working towards a simultaneous FEM and virtual reality simulation of scratch visibility powered by 3D rendering. For the first time, this study covers all aspects of scratch performance analysis from deformation characteristics to visibility. Visibility simulations provide a low-cost and efficient way to test the effectiveness of textures, patterns, and general scratches and complete the full cycle of Design-Development-Testing Virtually.
