We are utilizing convolution neural networks (CNN) to identify and characterize the scratch generated on the polymeric surfaces. The ultimate goal is to combine the CNN model with FEA and virtual reality based on scratch generation and visibility analysis.
Work in progress........updates will be posted soon.
