We are utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify and characterize the scratch generated on the polymeric surfaces. The ultimate goal is to combine the CNN model with FEA and virtual reality-based scratch generation and visibility analysis.

I trained a U-Net convolutional network for the task of segmenting and localizing surface scratches, the following detailed process was followed:
<br><br>
1. Data Collection and Annotation
A dataset of images showing various surfaces with scratches was collected to cover a wide range of scenarios, lighting conditions, and scratch types.
Using LabelMe, an open-source annotation software, each image was carefully annotated to mark the scratches. The annotations were done by drawing precise polygons around each scratch, capturing the nuances of shape, size, and orientation.
The annotations were saved in JSON format, which LabelMe generates by default. This format stores detailed information about each annotation, including the exact coordinates of the polygon vertices that outline the scratches.

3. Data Preparation
The JSON files from LabelMe were processed to extract the polygon coordinates for each scratch annotation.
These coordinates were used to create binary mask images where the scratches were marked in white (value 1) on a black background (value 0), matching the dimensions of the corresponding source images.
The original images and the generated binary masks formed a paired dataset, with each image having a corresponding mask to denote the location and shape of scratches.

5. Model Configuration
A U-Net convolutional network was chosen for this task due to its proficiency in detailed image segmentation and its ability to capture fine features in images, such as surface scratches.
The network was configured with layers suitable for the size and complexity of the task, ensuring that it could handle the nuances of texture, contrast, and edge information present in the scratch data.

7. Training Process
The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance and generalize its capability to unseen data.
The U-Net model was trained using the training set, where it learned to predict the scratch locations and shapes by mapping the input images to their corresponding mask images.
Regular evaluation on the validation set helped in tuning the model parameters, preventing overfitting, and optimizing the learning rate and other hyperparameters.

9. Evaluation and Optimization
After training, the model's performance was evaluated using the test set to assess its ability to accurately segment and localize scratches on new, unseen images.
Metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU), accuracy, precision, and recall were used to quantify the model's segmentation performance.
Based on the initial evaluation results, further fine-tuning and optimization of the model were conducted, including adjustments to the network architecture, training procedure, and data augmentation strategies to improve segmentation accuracy and model robustness.

11. Post-Processing and Analysis
The output from the U-Net model, typically in the form of segmentation maps, was post-processed to refine the scratch detection results, which involved thresholding and morphological operations to enhance the segmentation accuracy.
A detailed analysis of the segmented outputs was carried out to identify any consistent errors or biases, leading to iterative improvements in both the data annotation process and model training.
<br><br>
In summary, training the U-Net convolutional network to segment and localize surface scratches involved a meticulous process of data annotation using LabelMe, careful preparation of training data, strategic model configuration and training, followed by thorough evaluation and iterative optimization to achieve accurate and reliable segmentation results.
