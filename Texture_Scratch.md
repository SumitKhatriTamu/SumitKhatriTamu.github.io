Surface patterning and texturing can produce low-cost goods that remain appealing in a visual and tactile sense with the added functionality of scratch and MAR resistance. For example, Patterning on a macro-scale can be used to replicate natural materials like wood or leather, while adjusting the surface's micro-roughness influences the gloss level and visibility.
The analysis of scratch resistance of textured and patterned surfaces depends on the base material's influence on deformation characteristics and the influence of surface texture on scratch damage features. Moreover, textures help in masking the scratch visibility.
We model the scratch behavior of micro-patterned surfaces using FEM simulation by employing a powerful coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The effect of various pattern and texture types on scratch behavior is studied and validated with available experimental results. Results suggest the significance of patterned surface topology in improving scratch performance and effect of textures in masking scratch.
