Surface texturing can produce low-cost goods that remain appealing in a visual and tactile sense with the added functionality of scratch and MAR resistance. The analysis of scratch resistance of textured surfaces depends on the base material's influence on deformation characteristics and the influence of surface texture on scratch damage features. Moreover, textures help in masking the scratch visibility.
We model the scratch behavior of textured surfaces using FEM simulation by employing coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The effect of various texture types on scratch behavior is studied and validated with available experimental results. Results suggest the significance of textured surface topology in improving scratch performance and the effect of textures in masking scratch.
