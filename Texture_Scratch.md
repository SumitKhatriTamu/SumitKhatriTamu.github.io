Surface texturing is extensively used as a cost-effective solution to enhance the scratch visibility performance of polymer products while maintaining their appeal. Textures on surfaces reduce the effective contact area, resulting in lower surface friction compared to flat surfaces. Low surface friction is crucial for improving polymer scratch performance. Unlike flat sample scratches, scratches on textured surfaces are discontinuous, especially at lower loads. This characteristic aids in hiding scratch markings through visual masking, where regions of high contrast and shadow mask the initial discontinuous scratch. Gao et al defined these features as bruise spots observed at lower loads, followed by creeping scratches and pattern damage at higher loads in constant load scratch analysis.

We model the scratch behavior of textured surfaces using FEM simulation by employing coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The effect of various texture types on scratch behavior is studied and validated with available experimental results. Results suggest the significance of textured surface topology in improving scratch performance and the effect of textures in masking scratch.

The FEM scatch generation takes in to account the material constitutive model, surface properties and accurate surface topology to create a realistic scratch.

Once the scratch is generated by emplying FEM modeling, it is fed to the virtual black box to do scratch visibility analysis as shown below.
